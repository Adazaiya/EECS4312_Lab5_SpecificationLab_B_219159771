Prompt 1: "Implement the function is_allocation_feasible to determine whether a set of resource requests can be satisfied given limited capacities."
LLM Response 1: "The LLM explained that the NotImplementedError must be removed and provided a correct implementation that:

Copies the available resources to avoid mutation

Iterates through each request and each resource

Checks whether the resource exists and has enough remaining capacity

Deducts the allocated amount

Returns True only if all requests can be satisfied"

--------------------------------------------------
Prompt 2: "Is my implementation of is_allocation_feasible correct after removing the NotImplementedError?"
LLM Response 2: "The LLM confirmed that the implementation is correct and meets the lab requirements. It correctly enforces allocation constraints, prevents over-allocation, and handles cumulative requests properly. The response also noted that an optional check for negative request amounts could be added if specified in the lab handout, but the current solution is valid as-is."
